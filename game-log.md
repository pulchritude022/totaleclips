# Game Log

**Version**: 0.0.1

**Date**: 4-22-19

**Participants**: Morgan

**Playtime**: 2.5+ hours

### Feedback
* Game too long, only made it to Phase III in 2.5 hours
* Recurring rewards should be on the bottom of the cards so they can be stacked
* End of stage should provide better rewards
* It’s hard to differentiate between Locked and Dedicated
* Need a tie breaker for limited dice
* Add a reward “+1 to all dedicated cores”
* Should there be a Turn Order to resolve people going for the same dice?

### Feedback

Good Things:
* Simultaneous placing of dice is great, best feature of the game
* Using and rolling dice is fun
* Locking in is an interesting and fun mechanic
* Projects (and theme in general) are good and appealing

Problems:
* Game too long still, needs to be 30-40 minutes shorter.
* Limited Dice, ran out really quickly
* Rewards for ‘winning’ the project were waaay too high and gave too much advantage
* Projects gave so many victory points that Industry Algorithm was basically useless
* Players who get ahead will win more projects and maintain their advantage
* Players hit a wall around T3 unlocks that they can’t get past
* Recurring rewards are too strong, they are basically required to get past the “wall” you hit trying to upgrade to T3
* Game doesn’t end when there is a clear winner
* Trust is simultaneously useless early in the game but easy to get, and important to get at the end but impossible after Stage 3. New players don’t know they should stockpile trust.
* Knowing you NEED to go for “Hello, World!” is bad mechanic. Start with Trust if you need it. Otherwise just have normal projects.

Ideas:
* End of stage should also (only?) give base rewards
* Consider individual dice pools to avoid conflict over available dice.
* To decrease game length, maybe all projects clear each turn to tightly control the total number of rounds. Maybe something like 2-3 ‘normal’ rounds (8-12 cards), then 1 end-stage round. For a total of 12 or 16 total rounds?
* Consider re-adjusting the Rewards tiers to be in reach for all players.
* If winning a project give JUST recurring rewards and JUST losers get the base reward. It might slow down better players. If you get the high score you get a reward that pays off in the long run. If you’re weaker you get a bonus now.
* Some recurring rewards should cost something (Trust) so they’re not too powerful and you can decide to use them only when it counts
* Players should always have some options available such as: (T): Add +1 FLOPS, or (T): Re-roll a core. This helps get rid of extra Trust and eliminates the multiple back-to-back turns 
* Additional VPs scored at the end of the game for extra Trust, or for your unlocks etc.
* In order to make the game end when someone gets ahead, maybe there’s an always available project that ends the game? Players in the lead would try to complete it.
* If a turn order is needed:
   * It could rotate each turn, people hand around the “1st player chip”
   * It could go to the person with the most Trust
* Consider being able to lock in projects somehow, maybe in a more limited way than for the other algorithms
* Eliminate the concept of locked and dedicated as two different things, have dedicated cores producing Flops for you from the beginning so you don’t need to keep track of them. Using “Unlock TX” core mechanic as a means of freeing them up again. Expand step should be moved to last in this case to eliminate confusion

Random Thoughts:
* Would be nice to somehow use the M1 cores left over by the end of the game.

Layout:
* Differentiate the recurring rewards from the one time rewards better
* Typo: Expand last row should be T4 not T3
* Project dice placement should match order on center mat (i.e. in a line or in a square, pick one)
* The rewards listed for each algorithm blend together. It’s hard to pick out the payment portion. Maybe put that in bold?

**Version**: 0.0.2

**Date**: X-X-X

**Participants**: Aaron M, Ben B, Rachel B, Matt E

**Playtime**: XX minutes

### Feedback: 
* Make all projects different
* Some players didn’t get to the higher dice
* Maybe add more rounds

**Version**: 0.0.2

**Date**: 8-10-19

**Participants**: Aaron M, Tim Bumpas, Carl, Owen

**Playtime**: 95 minutes

End of Game state:

**Player 1**: 32 Quadrillion, 6 Trust

**Player 2**: 2 Trillion, 2 Trust

**Player 3**: 32 Billion, 0 Trust

**Player 4**: 128 Trillion, 0 Trust

Feedback:
* Put player colors on the sheet so you remember which piece is yours
* All projects should have different rewards
* Trust is hard to get in the beginning. Maybe start with Trust?
* Run-away leader problem. Best player keeps beating out worse players
    * Introduce mechanic where other players benefit when lead player gets something. “I get what I want, everyone else gets a little”
    * Add a bonus to lower end of score track that gets worse as you go up
    * Add penalty to higher end of score track
* No way to break ties when going for dice
* No order to who should use abilities when fighting over projects
    * Instead of projects being activate-to-use abilities, have them reward you with tokens you can place on spaces to benefit them (key is that they must be decided beforehand)
* “Upgrade” should be moved last because what does it mean to Upgrade a dice from the Industry section when it hasn’t been rolled yet?
*  4 boxes to each project square to make it clear you can only put 4 there
* Still not clear to some people that you can only allocate up to how many cores you’ve unlocked
    * Maybe as you reveal cores it tells you “Max X” or something?
* Current Tier-Tree does nothing, maybe move AI dice earlier to T3
* People didn’t realize the strength of locking dice
    * Mechanic to tell people to do this? Auto lock in on highest roll? First lock in is free?
    * All locking in is free?
* Pacing seemed good
* Random idea: Projects instead give currency for tech tree
* Come up with several strategies and create projects/rewards around those strategies
    * Early manufacturing
    * Many low value dice
    * Few, high powered dice
* Flavor change: Change “Conquer the Galaxy” to “Convert Observable Universe into Paperclips”
* Create a quick-reference sheet with turn phases and basic rules
* Idea: Make all sides of the AI dice give bonuses (upgrade cube, +1 M1 cube, etc)
* Idea: New algorithm, "Logistics"?, That lets you pick a bonus each round, like get a core, Trust, attack other players (swap one of your cores, take one of their cores)
    * Could also add a deck of cards with random, one-off abilities.
    * Sub Idea: AI cores produce no flops, must be rolled in the Log istics area, give all kinds of different bonuses.
    * Sub Idea: start game with one core and just the Logistics algorithm, first couple choices will unlock the other algorithms. Game delayed for 5ish rounds before projects come out.
